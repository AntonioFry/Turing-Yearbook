# Turing Yearbook

This application was built with `React` and follows a basic spec. All functionality is fairly basic and allows a user to add people to the yearbook page. The data used in this project is split into two data sets, one for the student and another for staff of Turing.

2. `cd` into the the directory

3. run `npm install` in the command line

4. run `npm start` in the command line to run the page (may take a moment to start a server)
